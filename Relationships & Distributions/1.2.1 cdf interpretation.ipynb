    "# **Cumulative Probability of Children:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The y-axis represents the cumulative probability of a couple having a specific number of children (indicated by the different colored lines) after being married for a certain number of years (indicated on the x-axis).\n",
    "Marriage Duration and Likelihood of Children:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The plot shows how the cumulative likelihood of having a given number of children increases as the length of marriage increases.\n",
    "Fewer Children, Faster Accumulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cumulative probability for couples with 1 and 2 children increases at a faster rate compared to those with 3, 4, and 5 children. For example, after 5 years of marriage, the probability of having 1 child is higher than that of having 2 children.\n",
    "More Children, Slower Accumulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conversely, the cumulative probability of having 3, 4, or 5 children increases more slowly over the course of a marriage. It is less likely to have more than 3 children early in the marriage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Summary:**\n",
    "- The plot indicates that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The likelihood of a couple having 1 or 2 children increases rapidly in the first 15 years of marriage.\n",
    "  - The likelihood of having 3, 4, or 5 children accumulates much more slowly, with the probability of having 5 children being the lowest.\n",
    "  - The total probability of having 1 or 2 children is higher in the given dataset, while the total probability of having 4 or 5 children is very low."
