## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Outline

This outline provides a structured approach to performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It covers key areas and techniques essential for understanding and preparing data for further analysis.

### 1. Data Understanding

*   **Data Types:**
    *   Numeric:
        *   Integer
        *   Float
    *   Categorical:
        *   Ordinal
        *   Nominal
    *   Boolean
    *   Date/Time
*   **Data Structures in Python:**
    *   Lists
    *   Dictionaries
    *   Sets
    *   Tuples
    *   Pandas:
        *   Series
        *   DataFrames
    *   Numpy:
        *   ndarrays

### 2. Data Cleaning

*   **Handling Missing Data:**
    *   Detect missing values.
    *   Imputation techniques (mean, median, mode, forward-fill, backward-fill).
    *   Dropping rows or columns with excessive missing data.
*   **Outlier Detection and Handling:**
    *   Z-score method
    *   Interquartile Range (IQR)
    *   Winsorization
*   **Dealing with Duplicates:**
    *   Identify and drop duplicate rows.
*   **Data Type Conversions:**
    *   Convert data types (e.g., strings to datetime).
    *   Handling categorical data (label encoding, one-hot encoding).
*   **String Manipulations:**
    *   Removing whitespace, special characters.
    *   Extracting substrings using regex.
*   **Data Scaling and Normalization:**
    *   Min-max scaling, standardization (Z-score).

### 3. Data Transformation

*   Aggregating and summarizing data (e.g., mean, median, sum).
*   Grouping data using groupby.
*   Pivot tables and cross-tabulations.
*   Melting and reshaping data (wide to long format and vice versa).
*   Calculating derived columns (e.g., ratios, percentages).
*   Binning continuous data into categorical bins.
*   Log, square root, and other transformations to handle skewness.

### 4. Data Visualization

*   **Basic Plotting:**
    *   Line plots, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, box plots.
*   **Advanced Visualization:**
    *   Pair plots, heatmaps, violin plots.
*   **Libraries:**
    *   Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Altair.
*   **Customizations:**
    *   Adjusting labels, titles, legends, and themes.
*   **Color Palettes:**
    *   Ensuring accessibility (colorblind-friendly palettes).

### 5. Data Summarization

*   **Descriptive Statistics:**
    *   Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation.
    *   Percentiles, quartiles.
*   **Correlation Analysis:**
    *   Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients.
    *   Visualizing correlation matrices.
*   **Exploratory Techniques:**
    *   Frequency distributions.
    *   Categorical value counts.

### 6. Feature Engineering

*   Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., date splits like year, month).
*   Encoding cyclic data (e.g., time of day).
*   Polynomial features and interaction terms.

### 7. Handling Large Datasets

*   **Memory Optimization:**
    *   Reducing memory usage by downcasting data types.
    *   Using chunksize in pandas for large files.
*   **Efficient Computations:**
    *   Vectorized operations.
    *   Libraries like Dask or Vaex for handling big data.

### 8. Statistical Testing

*   **Hypothesis Testing:**
    *   t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA.
*   **Distributions:**
    *   Understanding normality using tests like Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov.
    *   QQ plots for visualizing normality.

### 9. Time Series Analysis (if applicable)

*   Handling datetime data.
*   Resampling and aggregating time-based data.
*   Rolling statistics (e.g., moving average).

### 10. Reporting and Documentation

*   Generating reports using pandas profiling or Sweetviz.
*   Creating clean and readable plots for stakeholders.
*   Documenting the steps taken during EDA for reproducibility.
